                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                     when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                      It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                       electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
                       popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
                        Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
                    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation
                     and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms 
                     of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee 
                     the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs 
                     to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the 
                     same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly 
                     simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is 
                     untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, 
                     every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances 
                     and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will 
                     frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. 
                     The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: 
                     he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he 
                     endures pains to avoid worse pains."
